# Appa App — Phases 1, 2 and 3

A Tamil-first, voice-first Android app for Appa, built from the
[product roadmap](https://claude.ai/artifact/B9DWTfLX9QfvY3wMPEGWxP). It is a bridge to
people, not a replacement for them: every feature ends with Appa talking to someone.

## What is in this build

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Story of the day | One Tamil question each morning, read aloud. Appa answers by voice. Family hear it and reply with a voice note. |
| Call someone today | Suggests one person a day: whoever he has gone longest without calling. One tap calls; "இன்று வேண்டாம்" (not today) is accepted with no guilt and no second ask. |
| Payment walkthrough with practice mode | A spoken, step-by-step walkthrough of sending money and checking balance on a mock UPI app with a fake ₹5,000 balance. Moves no money and can be repeated without limit. Never grades him. |
| Medicine and sleep | Three daily reminders (morning sleep check-in, medicine, evening wind-down) and a one-tap "how did you sleep?" with a 7-day view. |

**Phase 2 — learning and daily structure:**

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Walkthrough library | 10 spoken, step-by-step practice walkthroughs on mock apps: WhatsApp (voice note by press-and-hold, video call, photo), UPI (send, balance, shop QR), OTP safety, bus ticket, food order (+ Tamil dish glossary), Maps directions. After finishing one, he can mark "I did it in the real app myself". |
| Scam alert of the week | A short Tamil story about a real scam pattern (12 in rotation), its giveaway sign and what to do. One tap forwards it to friends, signed by him. |
| Daily plan he owns | He builds today's or tomorrow's checklist from suggestions, by typing, or by speaking (Tamil speech-to-text). It never nags. Family can add one item a day each, shown as "அம்மா கேட்டது" (a request, not an order). |
| Health log | BP and sugar readings with gentle typo checks (no "high/low" verdicts), 8-week line charts, and a 30-day page to show or send to the doctor. |
| Family question board | Family ask by voice or text from their own phones (or on his). He hears the question and answers by voice. |
| What family can see | One screen, in his words, listing everything shared. Health, sleep and plan are off until he turns them on. Turning one off deletes the family's copy. |
| Weekly review | Settings → வாராந்திர ஆய்வு: the numbers for the Sunday review (stories, calls, plan days, walkthroughs, real-world wins, questions, 4 weeks of sleep) and the Phase 2 exit criteria. |

The family phone now has four tabs: stories, questions, Appa's day (only what he shares, plus one
request a day) and settings.

**Phase 3 — connection and companion:**

| Feature | What it does |
|---|---|
| Call someone today, extended | Contacts now have a group (family, relative, depot/work friend, friend, neighbour) and an optional birthday. After a call he is asked once "நன்றாக இருந்ததா?" (good / okay / not good, or skip); good calls lift that person in the daily suggestion, not-good ones lower them. Birthdays and festivals show the day before and on the day, with people to call — on his home screen, not as extra notifications. |
| Story archive | Stories grouped by theme (childhood and village, TNSTC years, repairs, colleagues, family, life lessons) with progress towards 40. Family can ask a follow-up about any story (from their phone, or on his) and it becomes the *next* day's question. Stories can be written out (transcribed) and the whole archive exported as one zip — every recording plus a text file — to give to the grandchildren. |
| Tamil voice companion | "பேசலாம்": he speaks, it listens and reflects in plain Tamil. Enforced by the app, not just asked of the model: an outward suggestion (call a person / tomorrow's story / today's plan) by every third reply; a soft 15-minute limit (he can set 5/10/15) that wraps up and points to a real activity; any affection, friendship or "I miss you" sentence is removed; health, money and family conflict always get "talk to the doctor / Ragul" and a call button, never advice. Conversations are not saved anywhere; only session length, whether it ended outward, and facts he can read and delete on "நீங்கள் சொன்னவை". |
| Pattern surfacing, with his consent | Four bad nights in a row, three companion sessions in a week with "unwanted/angry", or a week without a call: the app tells him first and asks "shall I tell Ragul?". Yes sends one short sentence (never a transcript); no is respected and not asked again that week. He can set "always tell" per pattern himself. |
| Weekly review, extended | Archive count, companion sessions, average length this week vs last, share ending in an outward action, whether he changed a setting himself, and a stop-and-rethink warning if sessions are getting longer. |

Still left out: his own bank's app and pension-portal walkthroughs (need his real details first),
dish photos, and push notifications to the family (pattern notes appear when they open the app).

## Tech stack (all free)

| Part | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| App | Flutter 3.47 (Dart 3.13), Android first | One codebase, strong accessibility, good Tamil rendering |
| Tamil voice out | `flutter_tts` → the phone's own Google TTS engine | Free, offline, no API key |
| Voice recording | `record` (AAC, about 0.5 MB/min) + `just_audio` | Works offline |
| Reminders | `flutter_local_notifications`, scheduled on the phone | No server or push service |
| Calls | `url_launcher` → the phone's dialer | |
| Storage | `shared_preferences` + audio files on the phone | Offline-first; nothing leaves the phone unless sync is on |
| Family sync (optional) | Supabase free tier: Postgres, private storage bucket, anonymous sign-in, row-level security | Family hear stories on their own phones |
| Tamil voice in | `speech_to_text` → the phone's own Google speech recogniser | Free, no API key (daily plan dictation) |
| Forwarding | `share_plus` → the phone's share sheet | He picks WhatsApp/SMS and the people |
| Charts | Hand-drawn `CustomPainter`, colour-blind-safe palette | No chart library needed |
| Companion + transcripts | Google Gemini API, free tier (`gemini-2.5-flash` by default), plain REST via `http`, behind a swappable `CompanionModel` interface | Free; good Tamil. **Trade-off chosen by the family:** on the free tier Google may use the requests to improve its products. Turning on billing for the same key stops that; Claude or an on-device model can be plugged in by implementing one class. |
| Archive export | `archive` (zip) + the share sheet | |

No analytics SDKs, no ad SDKs, no trackers. The only model calls are the companion and story
transcription, and only after the family enters a Gemini key. Walkthroughs are
scripted (`lib/logic/walkthrough.dart`), so they are deterministic and never confidently wrong.

## Run it on a phone

Prerequisites on the Mac: [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-android)
and Android Studio (for the Android SDK). Both are free.

```bash
cd /Users/ragulkts/Highonswift/Appa
flutter pub get
flutter test                 # 84 tests
flutter run                  # with Appa's phone plugged in, USB debugging on
flutter build apk --release  # APK at build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

The release build is signed with the debug key for now. That is fine for installing on
family phones by hand. Create a real signing key before any Play Store upload.

### On Appa's phone, once

1. Open the app and choose **அப்பாவின் போன்** (Appa's phone), then **தொடங்கலாம்**.
2. Allow notifications and the microphone when asked.
3. Tamil voice: **Settings → Accessibility → Text-to-speech → Speech Services by Google →
   Install voice data → தமிழ் (India)**. It's free and works offline. Use the app's
   *குரலைச் சோதி* button to test it.
4. In **குடும்பத்தினருக்கு: அமைப்புகள்** (settings), add his five people from Phase 0
   (name, number, relation) and set the reminder times and medicine name.
5. For the companion and transcripts (optional): get a free key at
   [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and paste it in settings under
   **பேசும் வசதி (Gemini, இலவசம்)**. Without a key the "பேசலாம்" tile stays hidden.
6. Sit with him for the first use, and for his first companion conversation.

### Family sync (optional, free)

Without sync, everything works on Appa's phone alone, and family can record a reply on
his phone during a visit. To let family listen and reply from their own phones:

1. Create a free project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In the dashboard: **SQL Editor → New query →** paste `supabase/schema.sql` **→ Run**, then
   the same for `supabase/migrations/002_phase2.sql` and `003_phase3.sql`, in order (already set up
   earlier? run only the ones you haven't).
3. **Authentication → Sign In / Providers →** turn on **Allow anonymous sign-ins**.
4. **Project Settings → API**: copy the Project URL and the publishable (anon) key.
5. On Appa's phone: settings → paste both → **பகிர்தலைத் தொடங்கு** (start sharing). It shows a
   six-character family code.
6. On each family phone, choose **குடும்பத்தினர் போன்** (family phone) at first launch, then
   in settings paste the same URL and key plus the family code, and tap **சேர்** (join).

Always shared once sync is on: his stories, family replies and questions, and his answers.
Health, sleep and the daily plan are shared only while he has switched them on
(**குடும்பம் என்ன பார்க்கிறது** on his home screen). Calls, walkthroughs and reminder times never
leave his phone. Row-level security limits every row and voice file to one household, and
refuses family reads of anything he has not shared.

## Before it reaches Appa

- **Tamil review.** Every script line (story questions, walkthrough narration, buttons) is
  plain spoken Tamil written by the team. Have the Tamil content writer and Appa
  rewrite anything that sounds bookish or patronising.
- **Phase 0 inputs.** Put his three willing TNSTC stories at the top of
  `lib/data/story_prompts.dart`, and his five people in settings.
- **Not yet verified on a device.** The tests run on the Flutter test engine, and the
  Android build has not been run yet. Test recording, playback, Tamil TTS,
  reminders and one-tap calling on his actual phone before handing it over.
- **Walkthrough order.** Reorder `walkthroughLibrary` in `lib/data/walkthroughs.dart` to the
  ranking Appa gives at the week-3 review. Refresh `scam_stories.dart` with what is circulating locally.
- **Ragul and Amma's commitment.** At least two real questions a week on the question board
  before it ships to him, or he will notice it is empty.
- **Companion, before he uses it.** Have Ragul and the team talk to it for a week first, in Tamil,
  trying to make it advise on medicine or money and trying to make it say it misses them. Check
  that transcription accepts the `.m4a` recordings (sent as `audio/mp4`).
- **Festival dates.** Lunar festivals in `lib/data/festivals.dart` are approximate; check them
  against a panchangam and add next year's.
- **Exit criteria (from the roadmap).** Phase 3: 40+ stories in the archive; companion sessions
  average under 15 minutes and at least a third end in a call, story or plan; he has changed a
  companion setting himself. Stop and rethink if sessions lengthen week over week, if he prefers it
  to calling people, or if Amma says it adds friction.
- **Earlier exit criteria.** Phase 1: used on 10 of 14 days unprompted, at least 5 stories,
  at least 3 calls from the nudge, at least 10 complaints. Phase 2: at least 4 walkthroughs and one
  real thing done without help, 6 family questions answered, a visible sleep trend, and Amma's
  word on whether the daily plan reduces friction. The weekly review screen tracks these.
